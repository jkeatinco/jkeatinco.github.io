          <h3>City: Cedar City, Utah</h3>
          <p>When news spread that a shooting was underway at the music festival, the Cedar City (Utah) Fire Department immediately sent crews to the home of Albert Alvarado, a seven-year member of the department. They knew his wife was at the show. Soon, news came that she was dead.</p>
          <p>Heather Alvarado ran an in-home day care center and worked with the department's Ladies Auxiliary. The couple had three children who would come along when they went on cruises together.</p>
          <p>"This is part of our family," Fire Chief Mike Phillips said. "There's no question that we are going to feel the soreness and loss from this senseless act of violence from this coward for years to come."(1)</p>
